Some nodes I created / am creating ðŸ¤—

I wrote a ***[GUIDE](wiki/creating-custom-comfyui_nodes-guide.md)*** for creating custom nodes while I was learning how to make these, it covers the general process of creating a custom node and some of the errors I encountered and how to fix them.

## *NODE* â€” Paste Cutout on Base Image

- Automatically matches size of two images with various size matching methods
- If the cutout doesn't have an alpha channel (not really a cutout), the bg is automatically inferred and made transparent
- Invert option
- Useful for creating logos and when doing things that require object segmentation/removal

**When the cutout doesn't have an alpha channel (BG auto inferred)**

**Alongside auto segmentation**

## *NODE* â€” Infer Alpha from RGB Image

- Chromakeying, remove white bg, remove black bg, remove neutrals, remove non-neutrals, remove by color
- Invert option
- Leniance/Tolerance/Threshold slider
- When you have an image that clearly has layers or is supposed to be a cutout but doesn't have an alpha channel, or you have lost the alpha channel at some point in the your workflow, and auto segmentation is not applicable

## *NODE* â€” Size Match Images/Masks

- Automatically matches size of two images with various size matching methods
