# Nodes

The custom node highlighted is red in the screenshots

## *NODE* â€” Paste Cutout on Base Image

- Automatically matches size of two images with various size matching methods
- If the cutout doesn't have an alpha channel (not really a cutout), the bg is automatically inferred and made transparent
- Invert option
- Useful for creating logos and when doing things that require object segmentation/removal

**When the cutout doesn't have an alpha channel (BG auto inferred)**

![paste-cutout-on-base-image-demo_pic-infer_bg](wiki/wiki-pics/node-demos/paste-cutout-on-base-image-inferred_bg-demo_pic.png)


**Alongside auto segmentation**

## *NODE* â€” Infer Alpha from RGB Image

- Chromakeying, remove white bg, remove black bg, remove neutrals, remove non-neutrals, remove by color
- Invert option
- Leniance/Tolerance/Threshold slider
- When you have an image that clearly has layers or is supposed to be a cutout but doesn't have an alpha channel, or you have lost the alpha channel at some point in the your workflow, and auto segmentation is not applicable

## *NODE* â€” Size Match Images/Masks

- Automatically matches size of two images with various size matching methods

# Custom Node Testing Tools

## Description 

- Class that tries to create automatically generate test cases that test every branch of node code which manipulates image tensors
  - E.g., for a node that composites two images, it generates all permutations of image size comparisons (e.g., img1 width > img2 width, img1 height < img2 height, img1 width < img2 width and img1 height > img2 height)
  - In addition to branch coverage, it generates test cases for:
    - Edge cases
      - Prime numbers
      - Bounds (0 or 1)
      - Uncommon file formats
  - Different tensor formats (CHW, HWC, HW)
  - Tesnros with and without batch dimensions
- Organizes and displays test results in a nice webview that highlights all the important information about each test case
  - Also with an image grid option
