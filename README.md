# Some Custom ComfyUI Nodes

Some nodes I created / am creating ðŸ¤—

I wrote a ***[GUIDE](wiki/creating-custom-comfyui_nodes-guide.md)*** for creating custom nodes while I was learning how to make these, it covers the general process of creating a custom node and some of the errors I encountered and how to fix them.

The custom node highlighted is red in the screenshots

### Paste Cutout on Base Image

- Automatically matches size of two images with various size matching methods
- Invert cutout option
- Useful for creating logos and when doing things that require object segmentation/removal
